# Design Decisions

## General Design Choices

### Omniwheels

- Using omniwheels for mobility to enable holonomic drive (movement in any direction without rotation)
- Custom CADded omniwheels designed for the specific requirements of the robots

### Electronics

- Custom controllers designed for precise robot control
- Custom firmware to handle the specific control requirements and movement patterns

## Robot 1: Shell Spinner

### Weapon System

- Brushless motor positioned in the center of the robot
- Shell initially driven by a full planetary gear system
- **Design iteration**: Simplified to just one planet gear and one ring gear to reduce complexity and weight while maintaining effectiveness

### Motors

- **Weapon**: Brushless motor for high-speed spinning weapon
- **Drivetrain**: Specialized combat robotics motors designed for durability and control in combat scenarios

## Robot 2: Hammer Saw

### Initial Concept

- Original idea: Linear rails that come crashing down, similar to roller coaster mechanics, to leverage gravity
- Chain-driven actuator to lift the weapon upward
- Pawl and ratchet mechanism to hold the weapon in the raised position
- Release mechanism to allow gravity-powered strike
- Concept: "Kind of like a punch to the face"

### Current Design

- Evolved to a hammer saw design
- Incorporated the ratchet mechanism from original concept
- Gravity-assisted strike maintained as core principle
- **Addition**: Springs added to provide additional power to the strike
- Combines both gravity and spring energy for maximum impact
