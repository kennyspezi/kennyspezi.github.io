hi! i'm <strong>kenny madrigal</strong>, a future electrical engineer and full-time autist... iâ€™m currently studying at the university of houston and building robots, plasma weapons, emotionally intelligent ai plushies, and sometimes my sanity back. itâ€™s a work in progress.

this space is for my thoughts, my projects, and the weird little digital world i want to carve out for myself.

### what i care about:
<ul>
  <li>building expressive, high-voltage tech that looks cool and feels alive</li>
  <li>bringing innovation and tech education  to laredo, texas</li>
</ul>

### okay but also:
