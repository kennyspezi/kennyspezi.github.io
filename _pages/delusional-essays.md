  <div class="essay-title">Hydrogen on the Horizon</div>
  <div class="essay-meta">Somehow, someway, when I was 16 I learned we could extract hydrogen from plastic and put it in fuel cells, and I fell down one of the deepest hyperfixations of my life. When I was a kid, I wanted to be an engineer. By the time I got to highschool, I lost that side of myself in an effort to mask harder. But doing a literature review on cutting-edge hydrogen fuel innovations and infrastructure made me remember how badly I wanted to be an electrical engineer. This essay covers how fuel cells work, the challenges engineers are tackling and how, and the potential for enviornmental impact of HFCVs.</div>

  <div class="essay-title">Analyzing the rhetoric of a post-genderist essay.</div>
  <div class="essay-meta">As an autistic girl, gender never made sense to me. I often resented gender and wanted to live in a world without it. In my junior year of highschool, we were assigned to pick apart the ethos, pathos, and logos of an academic article. I found this paper by Stefan Hirschauer that really moved me. It's a beautiful paper analyzing how people in relationships try to make sense of their roles in a world that is increasingly gender-neutral. I highly, highly recommend it. It was the first time I felt that my internal monologues were verbalized. I'll add a link to his paper soon.</div>

  <div class="essay-title">Rudimentary Electrolytic Cell</div>
  <div class="essay-meta">Honestly, this paper is kind of embarassing for me. I was really, really ambitious and bit off more than I could chew for a high school senior balancing a state-bound FTC robotics team, raging OCD, and classes in general. Mind you, this was for a Technical Communications class. But I really wanted to do a real science experiment and learn something about materials engineering. It's kind of childish. It would be endearing if it weren't for the fact that...it's kind of stupid. And even then, I still want to pick up this project sometime and do it right.</div>
